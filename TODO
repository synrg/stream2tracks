- output to a permanent location
- support output formats other than mp3 (flac, ogg)
- support input formats other than asx (must support titles for tagging)
- rename script (again) indicating it is broader than just asx & mp3
- some sort of cmdline interface
- fewer direct calls to system(), more natively handled things
  - reduce dependencies to a manageable set
  - provide abstractions around each pipeline stage to make it
    easier to support different backends
