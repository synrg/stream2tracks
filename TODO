- support input formats other than asx (must support titles for tagging)
- provide a more proper project structure: lib, bin, test/rspec/cucumber, Rakefile
- put code under test
- packaging (setup, gem, debian)
- write a man page
- serialize intermediate results and save to make it possible to
  reprocess stream, picking up where we left off if the rip was
  aborted
