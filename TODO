- output to a permanent location
- support output formats other than mp3 (flac, ogg)
  - ffmpeg now handles ogg
  - tagging is broken for ogg, however: instead of id3v2, use vorbis-comment
- support input formats other than asx (must support titles for tagging)
- rename script (again) indicating it is broader than just asx & mp3
  - workaround for now: symlink asx2ogg to handle ogg
- some sort of cmdline interface
- fewer direct calls to system(), more natively handled things
  - reduce dependencies to a manageable set
  - provide abstractions around each pipeline stage to make it
    easier to support different backends
- provide a more proper project structure: lib, bin, test/rspec/cucumber, Rakefile
- put code under test
- packaging (setup, gem, debian)
- write a man page
