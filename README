stream2tracks-

   A script to download all tracks from a stream container, transcode them all
   to the desired format, tag them using metadata from the streams and rename
   them to filenames derived from the tags.

   Currently only asx streams are supported as input and formats that are
   supported by ffmpeg and taglib2 (e.g. ogg, flac, mp3) are supported as output.

   This code is considered early alpha and therefore is not guaranteed to do
   anything useful at all. But if the rough edges don't bother you, it's sort
   of usable already.

Download:

   1. On Debian Wheezy/Sid, install these dependencies. For other platforms,
      install the equivalents.

      $ sudo apt-get install git ruby1.9.3 ruby-nokogiri ruby-progressbar ruby-taglib2 mimms ffmpeg

   2. Fetch the source.

      $ git clone git://github.com/synrg/stream2tracks.git

Install:

   3. Install using Minero Aoki's setup.rb, e.g.

      $ cd stream2tracks
      $ ruby1.9.1 setup.rb config --prefix=/usr/local
      $ sudo ruby1.9.1 setup.rb install

      See setup.rb --help for other possible options.

Usage:

   $ mkdir -p <output-dir>
   $ cd <output-dir>
   $ stream2tracks <asx-file-or-url>

   After some time, the script will finish and all output will appear in the
   current directory. Look in $HOME/.cache/stream2tracks/* if anything went
   wrong, as currently the working files are not cleaned up.

   The default output format is ogg, and I've tested ogg, mp3 and flac, though
   any format supported by both ffmpeg and taglib2 should work. So, for
   example, to output as mp3:

   $ stream2tracks -f mp3 <asx-file-or-url>

   There is an experimental 'multi' mode which downloads all tracks at once.
   This may work if you have a broadband connection, but could cause problems
   if you're on a slower link. e.g.

   $ stream2tracks -m <asx-file-or-url>

Where to find streams:

   A number of radio sites archive concerts and other programs as asx streams.
   I've tested the script with http://www.cbc.ca/radio2/cod so far. There may
   be some variations in the formats and metadata wrapped in the streams, so
   I would be happy to hear about your experience using this script with
   other sites as well.

   or wishlists is through the issues system.
