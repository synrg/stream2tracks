A script to download all mms streams from an asx container, transcode them
all to mp3 (or ogg), tag them using metadata from the streams and rename them
to filenames derived from the tags.

This code is considered early alpha and therefore is not guaranteed to do
anything useful at all. But if the rough edges don't bother you, it's sort
of usable already.

Setup:

$ sudo apt-get install git ruby ruby-nokogiri mplayer ffmpeg id3v2 lltag vorbis-tools
$ git clone git://github.com/synrg/asx2mp3.git

Install:

$ cd asx2mp3
$ cp asx2mp3 ~/bin
$ cd ~/bin
$ ln -s asx2mp3 asx2ogg

There is no proper cli, nor proper handling of output destination yet, but if
you want to do a test run, usage is as follows.

Usage:

$ mkdir -p <output-dir>
$ cd <output-dir>
$ asx2mp3 <asx-file-or-url>
   OR
$ asx2ogg <asx-file-or-url>

Due to https://github.com/synrg/asx2mp3/issues/1, the script will exit
immediately instead of waiting for all threads to finish. When the threads
all finally do finish, the output will appear in the current directory.
Just use 'top' or 'ps' and wait until it all settles down.
