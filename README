A script to download all tracks from a stream container, transcode them all to
the desired format, tag them using metadata from the streams and rename them to
filenames derived from the tags.

Currently only asx streams are supported as input and formats that are
supported by ffmpeg and taglib2 (e.g. ogg, flac, mp3) are supported as output.

This code is considered early alpha and therefore is not guaranteed to do
anything useful at all. But if the rough edges don't bother you, it's sort
of usable already.

Download:

1. On Debian Wheezy/Sid, install these dependencies. For other platforms,
   install the equivalents.

   $ sudo apt-get install git ruby ruby-nokogiri ruby-taglib2 mplayer ffmpeg

2. Fetch the source.

   $ git clone git://github.com/synrg/stream2tracks.git

Install:

   Assuming you have $HOME/bin in your PATH, install as follows:

   $ cd stream2tracks
   $ cp stream2tracks ~/bin

   There is no proper cli, nor proper handling of output destination yet, but
   if you want to do a test run, usage is as follows.

Usage:

   $ mkdir -p <output-dir>
   $ cd <output-dir>
   $ stream2tracks <asx-file-or-url>

   After some time, the script will finish and all output will appear in the
   current directory. Look in /tmp/s2t_* if anything went wrong, as currently
   the temporary files are not cleaned up.
