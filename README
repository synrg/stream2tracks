A script to download all mms streams from an asx container, transcode them
all to mp3, tag them using metadata from the streams and rename them to
filenames derived from the tags.

This code is considered early alpha and therefore doesn't yet do anything
useful at all.

Setup:

$ sudo apt-get install git ruby ruby-nokogiri mplayer ffmpeg id3v2 lltag
$ git clone git@github.com:synrg/asx2mp3.git

There is no proper cli, nor proper handling of output yet, but if you want
to do a test run, usage as as follows

Usage:

$ asx2mp3/asx2mp3 <asx-file-or-url>
... wait until all threads finish (see https://github.com/synrg/asx2mp3/issues/1) ...
$ mkdir -p <output-dir>
$ mv /tmp/asx2mp3*/*.mp3 <output-dir>
$ rm -rf /tmp/asx2mp3*
